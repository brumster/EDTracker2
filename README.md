# EDTracker2

EDTracker2 sketches for Arduino IDE. These are subdivided by various hardware
types; make sure you choose the sketch appropriate for the hardware you're using
(motion sensor, for example). Place these in your Arduino IDE sketches folder
(typically in "My Documents/Arduino").

NOTE: To make the build process easier, all the libraries and relevant hardware
settings are packaged up and available within the separate repo here :

https://github.com/brumster/EDTracker2_ArduinoHardware

You WILL need the additional libraries and modified Arduino core files provided in the
above repo; the sketches will not compile without them :)

EDTracker 2 sketches are currently as follows :

- EDTracker2_6050 - for use with Invensense MPU-6050 breakout boards (accel/gyro only)
- EDTracker2_9150 - for use with Invensense MPU-9150 breakout boards (accel/gyro/magnetometer)
- EDTracker2_9250 - for use with Invensense MPU-9250 breakout boards (accel/gyro/magnetometer)

Once built, you will need the EDTracker GUI software to calibrate and monitor

Tested/verified with Arduino IDE 1.8.5

A note that the source code for the original GUI was not my responsibility and is not available; I have never had it. However a community user has patched the old binary to continue working without the EDTracker website (which disappeared some years ago). His work is available here :

Love and manly hugs!
