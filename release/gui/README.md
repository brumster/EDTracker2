This folder contains the binary releases of the GUI for DIY EDTracker. Unfortunately I don't have the source code for the UI (and I'm not experienced with .NET either!) so at the moment the best I can offer are these binaries of the UI. Simply download, unzip into a folder of your choosing, and run the EDTrackerUI4.exe executable. Since the EDTracker website disappeared, downloading firmware files from the website will no longer work - if you don't want to install and compile from source using the Arduino IDE then you'll need to use the command line flash tool.

Alternatively, a community user has patched the old binary to continue working without the EDTracker website. This allows you to patch through the UI just like the original UI. For complete transparency, I must state, the software and the firmwares it patches into your device I cannot vouch for - so use entirely at your own risk :
